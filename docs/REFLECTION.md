# REFLECTION

**What I learned:** Agent strengths are scaffolding and boilerplate; human review is essential for domain math and invariants (banking/pooling).

**Efficiency gains:** ~50–60% faster on setup & repetitive code. Still reviewed all logic and tests manually.

**Improvements for next time:** Add e2e tests (Playwright), migration CI, and property-based tests for pooling to explore edge cases automatically.
