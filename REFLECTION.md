# Reflection

Working on this FuelEU Maritime compliance module helped me understand how real-world regulatory logic is translated into software. The most valuable part was learning how to separate domain logic from infrastructure using the hexagonal architecture pattern. This made the system easier to reason about and extend feature-by-feature.

Using ChatGPT as a coding partner improved my efficiency, especially when debugging TypeScript errors or deciding where certain logic should live. However, I learned that AI suggestions must always be validated — the agent is best used to accelerate thinking, not replace it.

If I were to continue improving this project, I would replace the in-memory repositories with a PostgreSQL implementation and add automated tests for CB, banking, and pooling logic. Overall, the project strengthened my understanding of backend architecture, React UI structure, and domain-driven thinking.
